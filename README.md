## Two-Stage Least-Squares Regression With Diagnostics

An implementation of 2SLS regression, based on the `ivreg()` function previously in the **AER** 
package, that makes provision for the computation of various regression diagnostics, including 
hatvalues, deletion diagnostics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances; graphical 
diagnostics such as component-plus-residual plots and added-variable plots; and effect plots with 
partial residuals.
