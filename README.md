Two-Stage Least-Squares Regression With Diagnostics

A new implementation of 2SLS regression that facilitates and makes provision for the
computation of various regression diagnostics, including hatvalues, deletion diagnostics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances; graphical diagnostics such as
component-plus-residual plots and added-variable plots; and effect plots with residuals.
