# Version 0.3-0

* Initial version of the `ivreg` package: The main modeling function is
  `ivreg()`, fitting two-stage least-squares regression for linear models.
  The function was essentially taken from the package `AER` (Applied Econometrics
  with R) but enhanced to provide further functionality within the package,
  namely computing and graphing a wide variety of standard regression
  diagnostics.
